# ImageLabelingGUI
ImageLabelingGUI was created for the labelling of keypoints in MRI images. The GUI follows a default structure with a specific dataset structure. The program was created using python 3.7.0. The use of the GUI precedes the execution of the init folder scripts, which need to be correctly edited with the paths of the User. The construction of a DataHelp directory is also required for labeling help information of the 3 different subsets (represented on the image). Both DataOrtho and DataHelp are adjacent directories (message me for more information).


## Installation and Setup
* Create environment for packages installation with python 3.7.0;
* Forward install the requirements.txt with the needed packages (**pip install -r requirements.txt**).
* Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.template`.
* Fill in the `.env` file with your own local paths and settings.
* Donwload the full content Dataset (Both DataOrtho and DataHelp with permission).
* Run /init folder scripts.
* Run the application.
