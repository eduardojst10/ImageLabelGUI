# LabelingGUI
The following LabelingGUI was created for the labelling and landmarks detection of MRI images. The GUI follows a default structure. The program was created using 
python 3.7.0. The tools used combine PyQt5, VTK 8.1.2, Pandas, Numpy, an old version of xrld 1.2.0 and json libraries. The use of the GUI precedes the execution of the init 
folder scripts which need to be correctly edited with the paths of the User.
